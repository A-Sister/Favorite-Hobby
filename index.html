      <p>My favorite hobby is dancing. When you are dancing there is no right or wrong way. I like to dance however I want. I don't like dancing in front of a LOT of people, though I have performed on stage. I won 2 trophies and 2 medals for performing on stage. At first I took dance classes and danced to bollywood songs, my teacher Sasha was a actress. I stopped taking them, and soon I started taking dance classes at my neibhors house. We danced to hindi songs. I've stopped taking those classes too. I find dancing more than a fun activity, but a way to calm my mind and relax. ‚ù§Ô∏è üëØ ‚ù§Ô∏è  </p>
